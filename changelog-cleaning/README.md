# changelog-cleaning


This action does the following:

- Takes the path to a file in the current directory (the caller's `CHANGELOG.md` generated by towncrier)
- Cleans the file contents so it can appear in the website docs and inserts the preamble
- Commits the cleaned file to a destination repo (i.e [metalbear-co/docs-changelog](https://github.com/metalbear-co/docs-changelog))

In the case of metalbear-co/docs-changelog, GitBook will update the live docs to reflect the new version of the changelog.

- **destination_repo**: Destination repository in owner/repo format
