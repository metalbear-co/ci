# e2e-actions
#
# When adding new e2e apps that require compilation (such as a new Rust test app) you have to add
# the building step here.
#
# For Rust apps, we have a little script (see # Build Rust test apps) that loops through the
# existing directories doing a `cargo build`.
#
# Be very careful when adding new build steps, as they have an impact on every other PR in 
# the `mirrord` repo.
#
# If you add a new build step, say to compile a Go program, but the code for this program is only
# in your PR, then all other PRs will start failing, as they lack yours.
#
# The best way to add new build steps here is to either do something similar to what's being done
# for Rust, or to do it as a conditional build, first checking if the directory/code exists before
# calling a compiler.
